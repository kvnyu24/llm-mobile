class TokenPruner:
    """
    Runtime Token Pruning Manager
    
    This class handles the identification and removal of low-impact tokens
    during auto-regressive decoding to reduce computation costs.
    
    Key features:
    - Computes attention scores to identify "low-impact" tokens
    - Removes these tokens mid-stream to reduce sequence length
    - Maintains a "shadow set" of removed tokens that can be reintroduced if needed
    - Reduces the quadratic cost of attention when sequences grow large
    
    Based on the second technique from the research paper on efficient
    on-device LLM inference.
