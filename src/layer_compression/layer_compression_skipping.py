class LayerCompressionAndSkipping:
    """
    Layer Compression and Skipping Manager
    
    This class handles techniques to reduce the computational cost of running
    Transformer layers through compression and selective execution.
    
    Key features:
    - Applies low-rank factorization (LoRA-style) to reduce parameter size
    - Implements dynamic layer skipping using a gating function
    - Maintains a "hot path" of essential layers that are never skipped
    - Adapts to varying computational constraints at runtime
    
    Based on the third technique from the research paper on efficient
    on-device LLM inference.
