    Model-Aware Memory Manager
    
    This class handles efficient memory usage for LLM inference on memory-constrained
    devices through key-value cache management and compression techniques.
    
    Key features:
    - Organizes attention key-value cache into "pages" for efficient management
    - Implements eviction strategies for older pages when memory is constrained
    - Applies quantization to reduce memory footprint (e.g., FP16 â†’ INT8)
    - Integrates with token pruning and edge-cloud offloading for comprehensive memory management
    
    Based on the fourth technique from the research paper on efficient
    on-device LLM inference.
